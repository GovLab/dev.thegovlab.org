    "long_description": "<p>During our first pilot in Monterrey, we focused on solving four problems: environment and reducing pollution; government efficiency and services; mobility and transportation; and public spaces and participation. </p> <p>The City received project proposals from 125 individuals (representing 52 teams) in response to the call to submit ideas to solve the problems described. They selected the ten best projects and we coached those ten teams in a 10-week program that combined online and offline coaching with mentorship from 20 different local and international mentors and 38 one-on-one interviews. As a result of the coaching, 6 out of 10 winning projects were being implemented within six weeks of the end of the coaching project. Learn more about the project\u2019s impact here.</p> <p>Based on our experience in Mexico, we anticipate that the Multi-City Challenges Program --namely running a City Challenge across multiple cities in parallel -- can accomplish four goals:</p> <ul>\n  <li><b>Problem Solving:</b> Help target cities make measurable and specific progress in their most urgent and important areas of urban sustainability by unlocking the energy and knowledge of multiple communities to increase shared prosperity, improve environmental impact, and bolster democratic legitimacy; </li>\n  <li><b>Training at Scale:</b> Teach public innovation and entrepreneurship skills to energize and empower civil servants and to help them govern differently and foster ongoing self-sufficiency in problem-solving;  </li>\n  <li><b>Replicable Process:</b> Give governments an empirically tested process (design and incentives) for engaging with their community on an ongoing basis to improve their effectiveness; and,</li>\n  <li><b>Social Cohesion:</b> Working across communities and focusing not on politics but on problem-solving will help to rebuild trust in public institutions and deepen democracy through civic engagement.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>The core goals of our proposed research are to:</b>\n<ul> <li>Deepen our understanding of the use and impact of open innovation for solving public problems;</li> <li>Assess and provide evidence for the premise that the Multi-City Challenges model has the potential to impact traditionally underrepresented cities in the innovation space in a variety of beneficial ways; and,</li> <li>Provide actionable insights to policymakers, civil society representatives, entrepreneurs, researchers and others seeking to use open innovation to solve public problems.</li> </ul>\n<p>City Challenges is far from the only program aimed at improving government, nor is it the first to use crowdsourcing, challenges, coaching, or impact measurement. What sets this model apart is the way it blends these approaches together to: 1) deliver immediately measurable impact; 2) build cities\u2019 long-term capacities to innovate through easy to replicate public engagement methodologies; 3) combine community and global expertise; 4) introduce experimental design to generate research insights; and 5) do so cost-effectively.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Board of Advisors</h2>\n<p>To support our efforts, we will draw on the collaborative insight and experience of the following Advisory Group:</p>\n<table class=\"e-people-list\">\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"https://ash.harvard.edu/people/teresa-acu%C3%B1a\">Teresa Acu\u00f1a</a></div>\n            <div>Associate Director for Democratic Governance, Harvard Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation</div>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"http://dznarayanan.com/\">Darshana Narayanan</a></div>\n            <div>Independent Researcher and Consultant at Polis</div>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulina-bustos-arellano-a8639610/\">Paulina Bustos Arellano</a></div>\n            <div>Co-Founder and Growth, C\u00edvica Digital</div>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"https://medium.com/@luisdaniel\">Luis Daniel Palacios</a></div>\n            <div>News Automation Team Lead, Bloomberg</div>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"https://www.medialab-prado.es/personal/yago-bermejo-abati\">Yago Bermejo</a></div>\n            <div>Head of the Collective Intelligence for Democracy Lab, MediaLab Prado</div>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/Laurapaonessa\">Laura Paonessa</a></div>\n            <div>Consultant at the Knowledge, Innovation and Communication Department, Inter-American Development Bank</div>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaimieboyd/\">Jaimie Boyd</a></div>\n            <div>Director of Open Government, Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat</div>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"http://www.c-knowledge.co/founders.html\">Carolina Pozo</a></div>\n            <div>Co-Founder, Knowledge Economy Initiative</div>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"https://citiesofservice.org/about/team/mauricio-garcia/\">Mauricio Garc\u00eda</a></div>\n            <div>Deputy Director of Cities of Services</div>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/silviadarosa/\">Silvia da Rosa</a></div>\n            <div>Consultant in Open Government, Innovation and User Centered Design, Data Uruguay</div>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"https://uc3m.academia.edu/CeciliaGuemes\">Cecilia G\u00fcemes</a></div>\n            <div>Professor and Researcher at GIGAPP & Carlos III University</div>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ofabro/\">Fabro Steibel</a></div>\n            <div>Executive Director, Institute for Technology &nbsp; Society of Rio de Janeiro</div>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"http://shuyanglin.com/\">Shu Yang Lin</a></div>\n            <div>vTaiwan Re:architect and Co-Founder of the Public Digital Innovation Space, Taiwan Executive Yuan</div>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <div><a href=\"http://www.mattstempeck.com/\">Matt Stempeck</a></div>\n            <div>Former Director of Civic Technology, Microsoft NYC</div>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n",

There is increasing recognition that this data can play a key role in solving some of the most difficult public problems we face \u2013 including problems facing children around the world. However, much of the potentially useful data is currently privately held and not available for public insights. Data in the form of web clicks, social \u201clikes,\u201d geolocation and online purchases are typically tightly controlled, usually by entities in the private sector. Companies today generate an ever-growing stream of information from our proliferating sensors and devices. Increasingly, they\u2014and various other actors\u2014are asking if there is a way to make this data available for the public good.

That Fellow - Christopher Wong - joined the GovLab in 2015.

Through such processes, the public becomes collaborators and co-creators in the legislative process to the end of improving the quality of legislative outcomes and the effectiveness of governing.</p> <p>Crowdlaw offers an alternative to the traditional method of lawmaking, which is typically done by professional staff and politicians working behind closed doors and with little direct input from the people legislation affects. Instead, we start from the hypothesis that crowdlaw has the potential to enhance the quality of legislation. Designed right, with the aim of improving the quality of outputs, there are opportunities at each stage of the lawmaking process, including problem definition, solution identification, research and drafting, subsequent crafting of implementing regulations, and monitoring of outcomes, to introduce greater expertise into the legislative process efficiently. At the same time, we acknowledge that, designed wrong, without regard for outcomes, engagement may only hamstring decision-making and deepen distrust of government. Thus, we approach this project not as evangelists but as critical researchers whose aim is to understand what works and when.</p> <p>GovLab is supporting legislative bodies in investigating, designing, implementing, and testing crowdlaw initiatives. Our work includes:</p> <ul> <li>Studying and sharing learnings about CrowdLaw practices in use around the world and convening practitioners to share learnings.</li> <li>Synthesizing best practices for the design of CrowdLaw initiatives\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding platforms, processes, and policies\u200a\u2014\u200athrough an on-going survey of over 25 public engagement initiatives.</li> <li>Cultivating a thriving network of now more than 90 CrowdLaw and public engagement experts and practitioners.</li> <li>Crafting a model legal framework to accelerate the integration of public input into the legislative process.</li> <li>Advising on the implementation of CrowdLaw practices.</li> </ul> <p>As part of the CrowdLaw project, GovLab has also created the following related products:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://catalog.crowd.law/\">The CrowdLaw Catalog</a> - a compendium of real-world examples from 39 countries and six continents demonstrating how legislatures, parliaments, city councils, and public bodies around the world are leveraging technology to involve more people in the process of making policies and laws.</li> <li><a href=\"https://crowd.law/crowdlaw-communiqu%C3%A9-vol-3-fall-2018-68763edd04c1\">\u201cCrowdLaw Communiqu\u00e9\u201d Quarterly Newsletter</a> - Designed for interested public officials, technologists, politicians and researchers, the CrowdLaw Communiqu\u00e9 features curated news, interviews, announcements, and recommended readings on the evolution of law and policymaking processes for the 21st century.</li> <li><a href=\"https://manifesto.crowd.law/\">The CrowdLaw Manifesto</a> - 12 principles to promote the use of CrowdLaw by local legislatures and national parliaments, calling for legislatures, technologists and the public to participate in creating more open and participatory lawmaking practices.</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zpEc-7YPYwd-yGuJ6XHD8Vd7x0WImy8\">The CrowdLaw Bellagio Interviews</a> - a series of short videos recorded during the 2018 CrowdLaw Bellagio conference, displaying the expert attendees\u2019 thoughts of the future of crowdlaw in the short-term and the long-term, the challenges they anticipate and about their favorite CrowdLaw platforms</li> </ul> <center><a href=\"https://catalog.crowd.law/\"><img src=\"static/img/projects/crowdlawcat.png\"></a></center> <p>&nbsp;</p> <center><a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/community/government-affairs/study-of-congress.html\"><img src=\"static/img/projects/brademas.png\"></a></center> <p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

But some states are already out ahead, establishing offices known as Data Labs or Policy Labs to enable states to partner with academia and make use of state administrative data to evaluate and ultimately improve programs and policies. By establishing the necessary technical infrastructure and governance mechanisms to help government gain access to much-needed analytical talent, these data labs are helping to convert data into insights and driving more evidence-based policymaking and service delivery. Urgently needed, however, are more such labs with the capacity to turn the data government collects into improvements in policies and services and the expansion of existing labs to enable nonprofits as well as government to evaluate their offerings using state data.</p>\n",

Based on interviews with directors and funders of these labs, the case studies look at the governance processes employed to share or access data and how these labs solicit expertise to enable program evaluation. We also published an essay on medium.com where we analyzed the various models of existing labs and the enabling conditions necessary to stand up a new policy lab.</p> <p>The goal is to provide data owners, particularly those that hold personally identifiable data, with a blueprint to securely, responsibly and ethically share that information to end of improving programs in the public interest.</p>\n",

In addition, this project introduces and expands the concept of \u201cbilinguals\u201d -- individuals that possess both domain expertise and data science capabilities -- as being essential to define questions that matter to particular fields and can be addressed through data science.</p> <p>The 100 Questions Initiative builds on The GovLab\u2019s Smarter Crowdsourcing methodology to match societal challenges with diverse ideas from curated global experts. More specifically, The 100 Questions will be sourced by bilinguals. For each domain, The GovLab will form ten cohorts of bilinguals who are invited to develop, evaluate and select the ten most relevant questions collaboratively. Once the bilinguals have produced and prioritized the ten questions, the public will be invited to comment and express interest for the ten most compelling questions for each domain.</p> <p>Together with domain partners, bilinguals, data holders and the public, The GovLab will strive to identify existing datasets could provide answers to the 100 questions \u2013 even if they are not easily accessible, e.g., proprietary datasets held by private companies. When confronted with data voids, the GovLab will attempt to define the new datasets that should be generated to help fill the gap.
